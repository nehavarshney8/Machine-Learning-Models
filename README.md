Model Evaluation

Explain how to interpret logistic regression coefficients

2) Random Forest:

A method by which a large number of weak/moderate learners(or learning algorithms) can merge to produce a better and more robust decision maker.

Why Ensemble Methods Work: The reason ensembles work is because of the diversity in the learners and any method of increasing diversity works in favour of the learner.

Bagging reduces variance of low-bias models

Low bias models are "complex" and unstable

Bagging averages them together to create stability

3)Boosting:

1. Fit a model

2. Compute errors/residuals

3. Fit another model on the errors

4. Combine Models

4) Python-Web-Api

An API (Application Programming Interface) is something that any particular website can design to this thing called an API to give out their data and allow your web application to communicate with that data. Facebook, Twitter, Yelp, and many other services rely and have their own API's.

With APIs, applications talk to each other without any user knowledge or intervention.

When we want to interact with an API in Python (like accessing web services), we get the responses in a form called JSON.
